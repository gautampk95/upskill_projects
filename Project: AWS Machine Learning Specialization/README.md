# AWS ML: Yahoo finance stock price prediction of Apple Inc. 

The steps are divided into 4 parts:
1. Build and train an Amazon SageMaker model (xgboost)
2. Deploy and test the Amazon SageMaker model endpoint
3. Create an AWS Lambda function
4. Build, deploy, and test an API Gateway endpoint for the REST API

The Python code used to perform all the above steps is shown in the Jupyter Notebook [AWS_stock_price_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/gautampk95/upskill_projects/blob/main/Project%3A%20AWS%20Machine%20Learning%20Specialization/AWS_stock_price_prediction.ipynb). The 3rd and 4th steps are mostly performed using Amazon services (e.g., Lambda, SNS, API Gateway services). The services used in this upskill project are as shown in the image below:
